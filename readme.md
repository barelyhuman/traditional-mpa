# traditional MPA template

The traditional style of writing REST API's with a few modern touches.

- Pure HTML forms instead of AJAX / API requests
- Template level styling instead of global styles
- Single use templates instead of a frontend framework/library

1. This isn't for everyone.
2. I kinda like traditional tech and methods cause they had more constraints and so had a lot more thought put into it. Today, these constraints are quite minimal so it's easy to extend on existing decisions while still keeping their performance advantages.

I could've written this in a 100 other languages to get even more perf but it's easier and faster to iterate in JS so that's that.

Also, most of the tech today is trying to run away from this "boring" way of doing things which gets
us amazing tools to work with but then fact is that these are still viable options to do web development in.
